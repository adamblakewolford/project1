Building a website for class

This website was built for a startup I am working on for New Venture Development class. The theme of the start up is around connection people to resale articles of clothing. Ideally, this would be at local thrift stores. Unfortunately, with shelter in place, the brick and mortar is closed so we don't have inventory right now.
